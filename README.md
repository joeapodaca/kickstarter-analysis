# Kickstarter-analysis
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

## Overview of Project
See how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goal.

### Purpose
Help Louise understand how her fundraising can be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
No plays were canceled and I thought formula was wrong.  Had to go back and manually sort the data to confirm.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater is most successful in May. Theater is least successful in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Plays with a goal of less than 1000 are the most likely to meet goal.  Plays with a goal from 45000 to 49999 never succeed while plays over 500000 have succeeded.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No plays were canceled and I thought formula was wrong.  Had to go back and manually sort the data to confirm.

## Results
Louise needs fundraise in May and should keep the funding goal less than 1000.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The best month to lanuch a fundraiser for Theater is in May. The least successful month to launch a fundrasiser for Theater is in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Plays with goals under 5000 are the most likely to succeed.  Goals from 5000 to 25000 have about a 50 percent chance of succeeding.  Goals from 25000 to 35000 and over 50000 have a low percentage of succeeding, but from 35000 to 45000 the success jumps back up with 66 percent chance of succeeding.  However plays with a goal from 45000 to 49999 never succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The total number of projects with high fundraising goals is a very small sample size.  There is no catagory for the plays which may contribute to them being successful. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Analysis of outcomes based on goals by country.   Analysis of outcomes based on goals by staff pick.
